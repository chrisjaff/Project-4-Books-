What does this app do?

This app allows you to find the books that you need by simply searching it's name and clicking on the book. Thanks to the awesome power of googles search tools.

User Stories

The user should be able to search for a book by typing the books title into the  search bar.
The user should be able a list of books. Along with the titles of the books, a brief description of the books content, and the URL for the google books page.

Technologies Used

In this version of the application I only a had full of languages

HTML - Page Structure
CSS - Page Styling
JS - Page functionality
AJAX - API Call Handler
Google Books API - Data Source (Where I got all of the books information)

Problems And Additional Ideas

I used this version of the application as a sandbox/planning ground for its angular counterpart.
This version was just intended to be made for testing purposes. The only problems that I ran into for this version was I wasn't able to get the URL's with on click functionality (You can't click the link and get redirected to the Google books page of the book). However, you can copy and paste the URL into the search bar and make it work that way. Also I was unable to get the thumb nail for the books to show upon screen.
